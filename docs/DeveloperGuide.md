### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [
`Main`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [
`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in
charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API
  `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [
`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [
`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in [
`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [
`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API
call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates
   a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which
   is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take
   several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a
  `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [
`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a
  `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

The `Person` component,

* stores all the fields related to a person.
* Tags are stored as IDs.

<div>

<img src="images/PersonClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

The `Tag` component,
* Stores the related data for each Tag, such as TagColor
* Each `Person` points to it via its Id.

<div>

<img src="images/TagClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

The `Relationship` component,
* Stores two Ids for each person in the Relationship
* Stores the Description for this Relationship

<div>

<img src="images/RelationshipClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [
`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo
history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`— Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`— Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`— Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and
`Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the
initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls
`Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be
saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls
`Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the
`undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once
to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once
to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as
`list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus,
the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be
purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern
desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 contacts without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. Everything should be accessible in the command line interface.
4. Most if not all features should be accessible using buttons if more convenient as well.
5. Not too big in terms of file size, 50MB maximum excluding all the data stored.
6. Every user interaction should have <100ms response time.
7. Data should be kept locally and accessed only by the user.
8. Data stored should remain consistent unless the file is edited directly by the user.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
* **Connection**: Refers to someone who you want to keep in contact, such as friends, colleagues or people you met from a networking event.
* **Relationship**: Refers to a connection between two persons in the contacts list. From one person you can see all the
  other people in the contact that they are connected to.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. **Initial launch**

    1. Download the Java Archive file and copy it into an empty folder.
    2. Double-click the Java Archive file.
       **Expected:** The application shows the Graphical User Interface with a set of sample contacts. The window size
       may not be optimal.

2. **Saving window preferences**

    1. Resize the window to an optimal size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
    2. Re-launch the application by double-clicking the Java Archive file.
       **Expected:** The most recent window size and location are retained.

3. **Launch from command line (alternative to double-click)**

    1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS or Linux).
    2. Navigate to the folder containing the Java Archive file.
    3. Run `java -jar <YourAppName>.jar`.
       **Expected:** The application launches and shows the same Graphical User Interface as a normal double-click
       launch.

4. **First launch with an existing data file**

    1. Place a valid data file (for example, `addressbook.json`) with a few known contacts in the same folder as the
       Java Archive file (or at the documented default data location, if different).
    2. Launch the application.
       **Expected:** The application loads and displays the contacts from the existing data file. Window size and
       position follow the current preferences.

5. **Launch with a missing data file**

    1. Ensure there is **no** data file in the expected location (delete or rename it temporarily).
    2. Launch the application.
       **Expected:** The application starts with an empty contact list (or sample data, depending on your product
       decision). A new data file is created at the expected location upon exit.

6. **Launch with a corrupted data file**

    1. Open the data file in a text editor and deliberately corrupt it (for example, delete a closing brace or insert
       random text).
    2. Launch the application.
       **Expected:** The application does **not** crash. It shows an error message indicating the data file is invalid
       and starts with an empty contact list (or a safe fallback such as sample data). The user can continue using the
       application normally. A valid file will be written on the next successful save or exit.

7. **Launch with a read-only data file**

    1. Make the data file read-only using your operating system’s file permissions.
    2. Launch the application, then attempt any action that would save data (for example, adding a contact), and exit.
    3. Re-launch the application.
       **Expected:** On the first run, the application either warns that it cannot write the file or continues without
       persisting the change. After re-launch, the change made earlier is **not** present (because the data file was
       read-only).

8. **Graceful shutdown via menu**

    1. Launch the application.
    2. Use the application’s menu (for example, `File → Exit`) to close it.
       **Expected:** The window closes cleanly. Window size and position are saved. Any valid in-memory changes since
       the last save are persisted according to the product’s save policy.

9. **Graceful shutdown via keyboard shortcut**

    1. Launch the application.
    2. Use the operating system shortcut to close the window (for example, `Alt + F4` on Windows, `Command + Q` on
       macOS, `Control + Q` on some Linux desktops).
       **Expected:** Same as a menu-based exit: the application shuts down cleanly and window preferences are saved.

   **Expected:** Application closes gracefully. The most recent window size and position are saved. Any pending saves
   are flushed to disk.

2. **Test case with extraneous parameters:** `exit now`
   **Expected:** Same as `exit`. Extraneous parameters are ignored.

3. **Other test cases to try:** exit immediately after adding or editing to confirm that automatic saving occurs before
   shutdown.
   **Expected:** On next launch, the latest changes are present.

---

### Saving the data

1. **Prerequisite:** Ensure the application is launched with a writable data directory.

2. **Test case (automatic save on mutation):**
   Run an adding command, for example:
   `add n/Save Test p/80000000 e/savetest@example.com a/Somewhere`
   Then close and re-open the application.
   **Expected:** The newly added person persists across launches; the data file on disk has been updated.

3. **Test case (non-mutating commands do not trigger changes):**
   Run `list`, `help`, and `find Zzz` and then exit.
   **Expected:** No unintended changes in the data file contents.

4. **Other test cases to try:** perform multiple edits in succession, then force-quit versus graceful exit to compare
   persistence behavior as per your product’s save policy.
   **Expected:** Data persists according to the documented policy.

---

### Editing the data file

1. **Prerequisite:** Locate the data file at `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Make a backup copy.

2. **Test case (manual, valid edit):**
   Open the file in a text editor and change a non-critical field (for example, update a person’s address to a new
   string without breaking the JavaScript Object Notation structure). Save and relaunch the application.
   **Expected:** The changed value appears in the application. No errors shown.

3. **Test case (manual, invalid edit):**
   Corrupt the JavaScript Object Notation (for example, remove a comma or a closing brace). Save and relaunch the
   application.
   **Expected:** The application does not crash. It shows an error indicating the data file is invalid and falls back to
   a safe state (empty data or sample data per your product decision). Subsequent valid operations will recreate a valid
   file.

4. **Other test cases to try:** set the data file to read-only and attempt a mutating command; edit tag objects directly
   and confirm that identifiers and references remain consistent.
   **Expected:** Appropriate warnings or non-persistence when writes are blocked; consistent behavior for tag
   references.
